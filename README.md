## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure that my code is functional and secure by employing static and dynamic tests. With static tests, I just do a personal code review where I go over my code looking for mistakes, and ensuring that I applied standard coding practices such as private class variables and appropriate constructors/setters/getters. I ensure that it is secure by running the code with deterministic output, ensuring that the output matches what I expect it to. From this course, i've also added JUnit tests to my testing repitoire and hope to employ it effectively inthe future.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I don't have a way to contact users and ask them about their needs/thoughts in my university assignments. Instead I just go with what I think is best while still strictly following the assignment guidelines and rubric to identify which parts of the code are important and how it needs to be structured.

## How do I approach designing software?

I'm still a beginner I believe. I don't have a "style" and I'm still learning, especially in regard to larger projects with multiple parts and many imports. At the moment I just design code according to the standard practices that I've learned, and try to ensure that it has a measure of funtionality while still meeting whatever guidelines I was given for it.
